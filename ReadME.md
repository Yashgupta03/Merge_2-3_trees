The source code file(.c file) contains the source code for Merge, MakeSingleton, Test and Extract.
For implementation of Merge, structure definitions and helper functions are also included which are part of the file.
These functions are called using the main function present in the same file. To test the implementation of Merge, the main function should be used to call the appropriate functions.
For the sample implementation, Test() can be called in main function and suitable changes can be made in Test() function to test the function of different sets.
